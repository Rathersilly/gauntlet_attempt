## Explanation for all the abominable code

So, since I haven't made any games before, I quicky confused myself
by using classical inheritance to make my game objects.

After extensive research (ie reading a few medium posts and watching
Timothy Ford's Overwatch ECS GDC17 talk (and pausing on the frames
that show their ECS design)), I have come up with my own first attempt
at an ECS.  It probably actually slows things down, and much of it is probably
redundant or misunderstood or just plain silly, but it provided a sane
enough structure to let me keep building.
